	<p>A cactus (plural: cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus)[3] is a member of the plant family Cactaceae,[Note 1] a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales.[4] The word "cactus" derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek κάκτος, kaktos, a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain.[5] Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth.</p>

	<p>I am just starting off as a new developer over at Grand Circus.  I have just finished up the basics of OOP and got a rundown on how MySQL functions.  I am now setting my sights on Javascript and HTML.  I belive that being a jack-of-all-trades is a great trait to have in a developer because of their flexibility and know how of all the other languages functionality.</p>
